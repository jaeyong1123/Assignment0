For example, if I make changes to a code so that it prints \"Hello world\", and then commit them with an informative message, I can look at the history of my commits and view the code that I wrote at that time. If I made some more changes to the function that resulted in an error, I could go back to the commit where the code was originally working. This prevents you from creating several versions of your assignment (assignment-v1, assignment-v2, ...) or from trying to remember what your code originally looked like.\n",

Two, leave informative commit messages. \"Added stuff\" will not help you if you're looking at your commit history in a year. A message like \"Added initial version of hello-world function\" will be more useful.\n"
